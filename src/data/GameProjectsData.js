This game follows Maui and\n        his hook, the Manaiakalani, as he grapples his way through different levels. Maui looks into the water and pulls up\n        an island that splits into many pieces, each piece being a level.

I was able to direct the team working on\n         this project so that everyone works on something different as a way to not overlap the workload.

I introduce many people to Unity, thought them some coding standards and had them try to\n        create their own scenes. With my guidance in the background we were able to put out a functioning game under the\n        time span. \n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"paragraph\">\n        I am glad that I started everyone out with this month long game jam because it seemed that a lot of people enjoyed\n        it and I was able to maintain membership for the Game Dev Club at UH Manoa. The actual game was pieced together slowly\n        as the month had gone on, we had created the game mechanics and had kind of worked backwards to create the story. So\n        the story goes as Sleepy Dan is trying to get through levels and levels of obstacles, he wants to beat up this alarm\n        clock so that he does not have to wake up. He has pets that follow him around which are just dream creatures that help\n        him through various levels.\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"paragraph\">\n    <div class=\"notice\">\n        Windows build available on <a href=\"https://snekuchan.itch.io/the-adventures-of-sleepy-dan\" target=\"_blank\">itch.io</a>.\n        Source code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/Chase-Lee-ui/Game_Jam_Game\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>", "#e48246", false, true)
