     <strong>Super Monkey Culture</strong> is a game project made with the Game Dev Club at UH, you play as a monkey that travels
     through time gathering artifacts for a museum to study their cultural significance. This game was submitted for the 
     <a href="https://itch.io/jam/cultural-heritage-game-jam" target="_blank">Cultural Heritage Game Jam</a>. This was a nice way to
     give spotlight to a couple of culturals that are here present on Hawaii, while also getting my team to learn more about Unity.
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
    The cultures that were given a spotlight in this game was Hawaiian, Mayan, and Filipino. The monkey had to set out and
    retrieve an ancient Hawaiian pig, a Mayan tablet, and a Filipino amulet. These would be put on display in the museum
    as a way to provide more insight into their culture.

        <strong>Manaiakalani</strong> is a game that was made by me and my Game Dev Club team, I had directed a plan of action
        so that everyone was able to pitch their ideas and hopefully see their ideas in the game. This game follows Maui and
        his hook, the Manaiakalani, as he grapples his way through different levels. Maui looks into the water and pulls up
        an island that splits into many pieces, each piece being a level. In respects to the GGJ theme this year, duality,
        Maui can both grapple towards and away from certains points that he chooses.

        This was the first 48-hr game jam that I have been apart of, and it was also quite a relatively big team as well.
        There were about 10 people who signed up to join and participate in the game jam process however, due to my other
         obligations I only really got to code on my parts within a 24-hr window. I was able to direct the team working on
         this project so that everyone works on something different as a way to not overlap the workload. We also had
         pretty good version control as none of the scripts or assets had broken upon pushing to the master.

        <strong>The Drone Project</strong> was my summer internship project where I had to simulate an environment and spawn drones
        into a scene in order to simulate drone image data. The drone image data is then sent over to a machine learning algorithm
        and helps it detect drones in real life. My experience during this internship has been invaluable for teaching me good
        coding patterns in C# and understanding project details fully.

    <strong>Square-Bound</strong> was my first ever team project that I made with Unity. This was for my first game jam, beginners
    circle game jam where anyone from any skill level can join. I got a group of my peers and guided them through Unity so that they
    can code some of their own levels and so that some of the weight of making the game is lifted off my shoulders. We did not have
    an artist in my group so I had produced all of the art for the game, since it was just a bunch of squares it was pretty easy
    to design

        <strong>The Adventures of Sleepy Dan</strong> is game submitted to the Buddy-up game jam where participants had
        a month to create a game. I chose this month-long game jam because there were many new people joining the club
        and as president I felt like I should be more accommodating to their time so I chose the longest one so that
        everyone can work on it. I introduce many people to Unity, thought them some coding standards and had them try to
        create their own scenes. With my guidance in the background we were able to put out a functioning game under the
        time span. 
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        I am glad that I started everyone out with this month long game jam because it seemed that a lot of people enjoyed
        it and I was able to maintain membership for the Game Dev Club at UH Manoa. The actual game was pieced together slowly
        as the month had gone on, we had created the game mechanics and had kind of worked backwards to create the story. So
        the story goes as Sleepy Dan is trying to get through levels and levels of obstacles, he wants to beat up this alarm
        clock so that he does not have to wake up. He has pets that follow him around which are just dream creatures that help
        him through various levels.
