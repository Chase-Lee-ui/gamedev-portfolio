      <strong>Coastar</strong> was meant to be an application to be used by one of the organizations that were participating in the Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge. My team and I participated in the NIC Hawaii â€“ Hawaii Marine Animal Response (HMAR) Sighting & Reporting App challenge, where we needed to create an app that would streamline the process for people who are around different parts of the island help identify animals that are in distress.

                <strong>Covid-Sight</strong> was made to mirror the lumisight app that UH uses for daily covid checkups with all of its capabilities. This means that the Covid-Sight app needs to allow users to do a daily check-up, upload vaccine status, have a log in, and a clear vaccination status update. Additionally, in this app, there is a check up history and the ability to edit the history.

                <strong>Campus Clearout Center</strong> is a project that allows UH Manoa community members to buy items that other members of the UH Manoa community are willing to part with for a small sum of cash.
