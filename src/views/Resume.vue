    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      I'm <strong>Chase Lee</strong>, a current senior at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.
      <br />After graduating from kindergarten, I've been enrolled in the army for 25 years, where I learned to destroy things in an amazing number of ways.
      <br />I joined the Delta Force because I thought it was Greek lessons, but I quickly adapted to this unexpected environment and became a key element.
      <br />I love teamwork, but I can also go in solo depending on the mission requirements.
      <br />
      <br />If you have any opportunity that I seem to fit feel free to

      <br />
      <br />Besides Game Dev, I also have some gaming hobbies such as being on a League of Legends team and playing Pump It Up
